# RML mapping

The RDF Mapping Language (RML) is a robust mapping language that extends the capabilities of R2RML, the W3C standard for converting relational databases into RDF (Resource Description Framework) data. RML allows for the mapping of various structured data formats—including XML, JSON, and CSV—into RDF, thereby facilitating the integration of diverse data sources into a unified semantic ecosystem.

Adhering to the syntax of R2RML, RML ensures that its mappings are backward compatible and can be represented as RDF graphs. This characteristic leverages the self-descriptive nature of RDF, enhancing the shareability and machine-readability of mappings. RML's versatility in handling non-relational data types makes it an invaluable tool for data integration, particularly in the context of Linked Data, where interlinking data from different origins is crucial.

By providing a standardized approach to define custom mapping rules, RML empowers users to create interconnected data networks. This contributes to the broader goals of the semantic web, allowing for more complex querying and data analysis across traditionally siloed data stores.
