# Introduction

Transforming non-linked data into linked data is essentially about connecting discrete pieces of information in a way that enables them to be more easily integrated and analyzed. Linked data refers to a method of publishing structured data so that it can be interlinked and become more useful through semantic queries. It's based on standard web technologies such as HTTP, RDF (Resource Description Framework), and URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers). Here's a simplified description of the process:

## Identify the Data
Begin by identifying the datasets that you want to transform into linked data. These could be in various formats such as CSV, JSON, XML, or even in relational databases.

## OSLO mapping



### Model the Data
Create a data model using semantic web standards like RDF. This involves defining classes and relationships (ontologies) that describe how different pieces of data relate to each other.

### Assign URIs
Assign URIs to each entity and concept within your data. URIs are unique identifiers that not only serve as references to your data entities but also potentially provide a way to access them via HTTP.

### Create Relationships
Define relationships between different data entities using RDF. This involves creating triples that consist of a subject, predicate, and object, essentially linking different pieces of data.

### standardize Data Formats
Convert your data into a standard format that can be easily integrated with other datasets. RDF is a common format for linked data, but there are others like Turtle or JSON-LD.
