# Publishing Linked Data Sets as LDES

Once entities are available in the formed of versioned linked data objects, they can be published as an LDES Stream using a component called [LDES Server](https://informatievlaanderen.github.io/VSDS-Tech-Docs/introduction/LDES_server).

The LDES Server is a tool which can be used to publish versioned linked data objects as a stream. In other words, once a dataset has been enhanced with a data model in a linked data form, it can be made available as LDES using the LDES Server.

The LDES Server enables a set of LDES-specific features which consumers expect to find like fragmentation for easier data access, pagination, caching, retention management etc.
